#+title: clojure-utils

Utility functions I tend to use in many of my projects.

* Usage

 ~cond-pred->~  Is used in cases where I need to conditionally change a value based on the value itself. This is as opposed to using ~cond->~ so that I don't have to pass the value into the condition again.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(cond-pred-> {:have :a} :have vals)
;; => (:a)
#+END_SRC
